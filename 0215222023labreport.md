# 02.15.2023 - 02.22.2023 Lab Report: CSE Done Quick

This week for lab, we had a competition in order to see who could complete a task the fastest. The steps of the task are as follows:

1) Log into ieng6
2) Clone your fork of the (repository)[https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7] from your Github account
3) Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
4) Edit the code file to fix the failing test
5) Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
6) Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account 

On my initial run, it took me around 2 minutes and 46 seconds right after starting the timer, but using certain strategies helped me get down to around 57 seconds. Here are the steps I took below.

## 1) Log into ieng6

```
<up> <enter>
```

The majority of the steps I used included utilizing bash history in order to speed up the process. The actu This meant that I wouldn't have to do too much typing. Another thing that helped speed up this process was that I was able to bypass my login to ieng6 through using an ssh key. The actual command was as follows, saved from my history and accessed through using the up arrow.

## 2) Clone your fork of the repository

```
git clone <ctrl+shift+c> git@github.com:jewelle-tatad/lab7.git <enter>
```

For this, I typed out git clone and copy and pasted in the ssh repo from github.


## 3) Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail 

```
cd lab7/ <enter>
<up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <enter>
<up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <up> <enter>
```

At the point, I had done the lab a couple of times, so my bash history looked something like this:

```
git clone git@github.com:jewelle-tatad/lab7.git
cd lab7/
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples 
nano ListExamples.java
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java # this is the command i ran second!
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples # this is the command i ran third!
git add ListExamples.java
git commit -m "Done"
git clone git@github.com:jewelle-tatad/lab7.git
cd lab7/
```

This allowed me to cut down on typing time by just going up through my history to utilize these commands. I could've also used this strategy for the first two commands.

## 4) Edit the code file to fix the failing test

```
nano List <tab> java <enter>

# actual command: nano ListExamples.java
```

In this step, I used the tab function to autocomplete my command name, also saving on typing time. This command brings up a text editor in the command line, where I used the arrow keys to go find and fix the rror at the bottom before saving and exiting.

## 5) Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

```
<up> <up> <up> <enter>
<up> <up> <up> <enter>
```

Since I had recently used these commands, I used the up arrow to recompile and rerun the tests. By this point, my bash history looked something like this:

```
git clone git@github.com:jewelle-tatad/lab7.git
cd lab7/
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples 
nano ListExamples.java
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples
git add ListExamples.java
git commit -m "Done"
git clone git@github.com:jewelle-tatad/lab7.git
cd lab7/
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java # this is the command i ran first!
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples # this is the command i ran second!
nano ListExamples.java
```

## 6) Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account 

```
git commit -m "Done"
```

Again, I could've used the up arrow keys to find this command, but 9/10 I'm pretty sure I just typed it out. If I were to use the up arrow keys, it would've been <up> * 8 <enter>.

I learned about the up arrow trick last quarter during CSE 11 and it has definitely been a timesaver! The tab trick is also good and saves me a lot of time. I hope that these techniques will help me become more efficient in the future.
