# 03.01.2023 - 03.08.2023 CLDQ bash script

In the previous lab, I talked about a competition we had in our CSE 15L on how to do what was essentially a skill demo task in a short amount of time. You can look back at that lab report (here)[https://jewelle-tatad.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/0215222023labreport.html], but I have reproduced the steps below.

1) Log into ieng6

2) Clone your fork of the (repository)[https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7] from your Github account

3) Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

4) Edit the code file to fix the failing test

5) Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

6) Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account 

In order to get my time down to less than a minute, I utilized the up arrow key and my bash history in order to save on time, but what if I could do this with a bash script? Here are the commands below I had in my bash history in order to complete this task.

```
ssh cs15lwi23aba@ieng6.ucsd.edu
git clone git@github.com:jewelle-tatad/lab7.git
cd lab7/
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples 
nano ListExamples.java
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples 
git commit -m "Done"
```
