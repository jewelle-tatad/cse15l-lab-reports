# 03.01.2023 - 03.08.2023 CLDQ bash script

In the previous lab, I talked about a competition we had in our CSE 15L on how to do what was essentially a skill demo task in a short amount of time. You can look back at that lab report [here](https://jewelle-tatad.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/0215222023labreport.html), but I have reproduced the steps below.

1) Log into ieng6

2) Clone your fork of the [repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7) from your Github account

3) Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

4) Edit the code file to fix the failing test

5) Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

6) Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account 

In order to get my time down to less than a minute, I utilized the up arrow key and my bash history in order to save on time, but what if I could do this with a bash script? Here are the commands below I had in my bash history in order to complete this task.

```
ssh cs15lwi23aba@ieng6.ucsd.edu
git clone git@github.com:jewelle-tatad/lab7.git
cd lab7/
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples 
nano ListExamples.java
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples 
git add ListExamples.java
git commit -m "Done"
```

I put some of these commands into a bash script. The contents of the bash script are as follows:

```
# lab7.sh
git clone git@github.com:jewelle-tatad/lab7.git
cd lab7/
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples 
nano ListExamples.java
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples 
git add ListExamples.java
git commit -m "Done"
```

These are the steps I followed now that I have the bash script doing most of my commands.

## 1) Copy the bash script into the ieng6 server.

```
scp Documents/lab7.sh cs15lwi23aba@ieng6.ucsd.edu:
```

The scp command copies my bash script from my local machine to the ieng6 server. This is necessary for me to be able to run the command directly in ieng6, as I tried adding the ssh into my script and it did not work as intended. The command would log into ieng6, but would not run the bash script until I logged out, which was not the outcome I wanted.

## 2) Log into the remote server

```
ssh cs15lwi23aba@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

As stated in the last lab, I was able to configure the ssh command to help me bypass my password, so this step shouldn't take too long.

## 3) Run the bash script

```
bash lab7.sh
```

It is helpful to use `ls lab7.sh` before this command in order to check that your script copied over. The bash command will run my script and go through all the steps I have written above.

## 4) Fix the error

At the moment, the script is at this command:

```
nano ListExamples.java
```

The script pauses here and opens the nano text editor, so I use the arrow keys to go down to the last couple of lines in order to change index1 to index2. I then save using Ctrl O and exit using Ctrl X.

## 5) Run the rest of the script

After I exit using Ctrl X, the rest of the bash script runs, committing the change to Github.

Using this bash script helped me cut down to around 25-30 seconds, cutting my time down to about half. Using a bash script greatly cuts down the amount of time in order to do this task.
