# 01.18.2023 - 01.25.2023 Lab Report: Servers and Bugs

For the past two weeks, we have been working with servers. In this report, I will be going over the following:

- Codes and methods for servers using an example
- A bug I ran into during the lab, as well as its fix
- Things I didn't know about before I did the lab

## StringServer
I will be using the code for StringServer in order to demonstrate. This is based off of the NumberServer.java file we used in lab 2.
```
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URI;

class Handler implements URLHandler {
    // The one bit of state on the server: a number that will be manipulated by
    // various requests.
    String strHistory = "";

    /**
     * This method takes in a URI/URL to handle requests and counts how many times you've visited
     * the page.
     */
    public String handleRequest(URI url) {
        /**
         * Checks path
         * If in the default (/) path, display the total count (num)
         */
        if (url.getPath().equals("/")) {
            return strHistory;
        // if add-message, concatenate message to the end of string History
        } else {
            System.out.println("Path: " + url.getPath());
            if (url.getPath().contains("/add-message")) {
                // splits at = to create an array
                String[] parameters = url.getQuery().split("=");
                // looks for object "s" at the first idx of the parameters[]
                if (parameters[0].equals("s")) {
                    // adds str to strHistory
                    strHistory += parameters[1] + "\n";
                    return strHistory;
                }
            }
            return "404 Not Found!";
        }
    }
}

public class StringServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        if(args.length == 0){
            System.out.println("Missing port number! Try any number between 1024 to 49151");
            return;
        }

        int port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        Server.start(port, new Handler());
    }
    
}
```
In order to start up the server on your local device, I compiled this code and a provided Server.java file and specified a port number when running.

```
$ javac StringServer.java Server.java
$ java StringServer 4040 # This number after StringServer is the port number.
Server Started! Visit http://localhost:4040 to visit.
```

Clicking on the link in my browser leads to the following.

As you can see, there's currently nothing there! This is because we haven't added any messages yet. I will be adding messages using the following query.

```
/add-message?s=<string>
```

This calls the method handleRequest in the StringServer file, and if I've put the path in correctly, it should concatenate the string to the end of strHistory and display the string onto the webpage. Let's try that now!

```
http://localhost:4040/add-message?s=hiiiiii
handleRequest(http://localhost:4040/add-message?s=hiiiiii)
```

The method handleRequest was called, passing through the query when it detects "add-message" and adding in the string after "s=". The string after the query concatenates to strHistory and returns it.

The same code should be called if we were to do this again.

```
http://localhost:4040/add-message?s=who%20are%20you # %20 is inserted everywhere a space was in your query. This should display as "who are you"
handleRequest(http://localhost:4040/add-message?s=who%20are%20you)
```

Again, handleRequest is called, and the value of strHistory is changed when "who are you" is concatenated.

If we were to pass in a request with the root path, the following would happen.

```
http://localhost:4040/
handleRequest(http://localhost:4040/)
```

Since the path equals "/", it will return the curent strHistory. No values will change.

If we were to pass in something that didn't have a specified path, handleRequest should return a "404 Not Found!" error.

```
http://localhost:4040/dance
handleRequest(http://localhost:4040/dance)
```

Because there was no specified path for "/dance", handleRequest returned a "404 Not Found!" error.

## Bugs
During lab 3, we had to debug some code. The original code for one of the examples is provided below, and the starter code for this lab can be viewed [here.](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab3)

```
public class ArrayExamples {

  // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) { // bug here
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }

}
```

If we were to pass in the following test case, the code would pass.

```
@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
}
```

However, this next test case is a failure inducing input and does not match the expected outcome.

```
@Test
  public void testReverseInPlace2() {
    int[] input1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{4, 3, 2, 1}, input1);
  }
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122484428/215628391-36c0d040-102c-4cd9-a686-ab41cf1cf8cc.png)

The current symptom is that the array is not reversing properly on arrays with lengths greater than 1. Through code tracing, we can figure out that the code is overwriting over the array and causing it to not properly reverse one half of the array. That means that instead of being {4, 3, 2, 1}, input1 is instead {4, 3, 3, 4}.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122484428/215630283-ead7aaef-68c0-46c8-bc41-c6d7e34c1cee.png)

To fix this, we half the array length and use a temporary variable in order to switch the two values on opposite sides of the array.


```
public class ArrayExamples {

  // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) { // changed arr.length to arr.length/2 here
      int temp = arr[i]; // temp variable to prevent overwriting
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1]; // switches both arr[i]...
      arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp; // ...and arr[arr.length - i - 1]
    }
  }


}
```

If we were to trace through this, the result will be {4, 3, 2, 1}.

## More Info
During the past two labs, I learned a lot of new things. With lab 2, I learned how to start up a server on not only my local machine but also on a remote computer. I've touched on the process for starting up a server in the first part of the lab report, but I'll go into more detail here.

In the starter code for lab 2, we were given a file Server.java that we compile alongside our web server code. I used this command to start up StringServer in the first part of this lab.

```
$ javac StringServer.java Server.java
$ java StringServer 4040 # This number after StringServer is the port number.
Server Started! Visit http://localhost:4040 to visit.
```

You can also run these servers from remote servers. I logged into the ieng6 server [(more information here if you need to know how to log into a server)](https://jewelle-tatad.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/01112023labreport.html) and cloned my files in order to run them from a computer on the ieng6 server instead of my local machine. 

```
git clone <your-repository-url-for-your-fork>
```

As long as you are in the directory where your files are, you can compile and run them. An interesting thing about this is that you can also share this web address to other students and they are also able to see your server on their own device, as well as input queries that change across the same server.
