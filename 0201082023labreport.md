# 02.01.2023 - 02.08.2023 Lab Report: Researching Commands

For this lab report, I will researching the command "grep," which was used in our labs and skill demo recently.

So what is grep? According to ChatGPT:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122484428/218614895-25d576fd-7b3a-463d-af75-fb13bb0aeda4.png)

I also asked my bash terminal using the following command and it gave me some examples of its usage.

```
$ grep --help
Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...
Search for PATTERN in each FILE or standard input.
PATTERN is, by default, a basic regular expression (BRE).
Example: grep -i 'hello world' menu.h main.c
```

In short, grep is used to search for an expression in a specified file or file. Both bash and ChatGPT provided some examples of how they can be used, and I will be using them on files from ./written_2 from our skill demo/lab. All of the options used were found by typing "grep --help".

## $ grep -c

```
$ grep -c "Italy" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/IntroItaly.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/IntroItaly.txt:8
```

The option "-c" counts how many times an expression (in this case, Italy") shows up in a file. By using grep, we can see that in the file IntroItaly.txt, Italy shows up 8 times.

```
$ grep -c "Italy" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/*.txt
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRHawaii.txt:0
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRHongKong.txt:0
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRIbiza.txt:0
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRIsrael.txt:0
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRIstanbul.txt:0
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRJamaica.txt:0
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRJerusalem.txt:0
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRLakeDistrict.txt:0
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRLasVegas.txt:0
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRLisbon.txt:0
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HandRLosAngeles.txt:0
...
```

This can also be used in a list of files. This command returns all files ending in .txt in the berlitz1 directory, displaying how many times Italy shows up in their files, including the file IntroItaly.txt (although it is not shown because this list is very very long).

## $ grep -o

```
$ grep -o "A Stitch"  written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/*.txt
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt:A Stitch
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt:A Stitch
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt:A Stitch
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt:A Stitch
```

The option -o shows only part of the line that matches the pattern. This is useful as another way to count all the instances of where you can find a certain string. If we were to use grep without -o, the output would look something like this.

```
$ grep "A Stitch"  written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/*.txt
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt:The changes we examine in retailing are not only profound but rippling through a growing segment of the American economy. They have already transformed channel relations in such industries as food and grocery, home-building products, personal computers, and office products. The retail revolution is affecting the automobile, health care, and pharmaceutical industries as well. Now that manufacturers of power tools and ball bearings talk about their products as “fashion” items, the apparel industry—always subject to the whims of fashion—has much to say to any industry that involves retailing. Every channel has its particular history, elements, and dynamics, and retail-apparel-textile channels are no exception. A Stitch in Time uses the U.S. apparel story to highlight the transformation of retailing and manufacturing across the board.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt:Because of our separate academic perspectives and disciplines, the research underlying A Stitch in Time comes from a variety of sources. Much of our analysis is based on detailed survey data we collected from 118 business units—a sample representing about one-third of the shipments—in the apparel industry. We supplemented the original survey with microdata collected from a variety of U.S. government and private sources. Our work also draws on numerous case studies of individual enterprises and data gathered at site visits. We have modeled specific channel dynamics in order to understand what optimal practices might look like as the channel develops over time. Finally, we have worked closely with business executives, government officials, labor leaders, and our academic colleagues to exchange views, test ideas, and refine our results on a continuing basis. The appendices present a list of acronyms, a description of the HCTAR survey and other data sources, and a list of companies that we visited or at which we conducted interviews with their executives.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt:A Stitch in Time is organized into five sections, roughly corresponding to the channel components. The first two chapters provide an overview and historical context. Chapters 3 through 5 analyze developments in the retail sector. Chapters 6 and 7 establish a bridge between retailing and apparel/textile operations through an exploration of the problems of inventory management—a central aspect of emerging channel dynamics. Chapters 8 through 10 focus on the apparel industry; Chapters 11 and 12 look at textiles. Chapters 13 through 15 examine the channel as a whole, from global, private-performance, and public-policy perspectives.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt:A Stitch in Time concludes with a look at the many factors shaping today’s retail-apparel-textile channel—from the complex management challenges facing suppliers to labor standards and macroeconomic policy. Chapter 13 (“The Global Marketplace”) reviews trends in U.S. imports and exports of apparel and textiles, including information on trade by countries and specific products. It then connects these trends to changing trade policies, emphasizing the growing regionalization of trade flows in different parts of the world. Chapter 14 (“Suppliers in a Lean World”) examines our survey results from another angle, evaluating firm performance in an integrated channel. Here we highlight the importance of combining information technologies, manufacturing innovations, and new methods of management to respond to lean retailing demands.
```

Without -o, all of the line is returned containing the string "A Stitch". You can combine -o with -n to print line numbers so that you dont have to print out the entirety of a line to find a match.

```
$ grep -o -n  "A Stitch"  written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/*.txt
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt:14:A Stitch
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt:69:A Stitch
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt:70:A Stitch
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt:76:A Stitch
```

## $ grep -h

```
$ grep -h  "mechanical"  written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/*.txt
Carnot set about understanding the fundamentals of the extraction of mechanical work from thermal energy sources. The result of his eVort was an analysis of an idealized device to extract mechanical work from heat, the Carnot cycle. Carnot titled his work “An Investigation on the Motive Force of Heat.”
A second point of fascination is that Carnot carried out his crucial analysis just as steam was becoming established as a source of mechanical work. It is almost certainly not a coincidence that the impulse to investigate the central nature of autonomous agents arises just as we are on the threshold of creating such molecular systems. Science, technology, and art tumble into the adjacent possible in roughly equal and yoked pace.
...
```

The option -h can be used to hide the file prefixes behind a grep result, which is useful if you already know what directory you're in and if you're just looking for a certain piece of information quickly.

```
$ grep -h -c  "mechanical"  written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/*.txt
0
0
7
6
1
1
1
0
0
```

Interestingly, this can be combined with -c to show how many instances are found in each file, though it is definitely a bit more useful to have the file names present even if you already know the directory.

## $ grep -m num

```

The option -m NUM prints the first NUM (in this case, NUM = 5) of the specified string. This can be useful if you need to quickly skim through a directory for information, as you can check the first few instances for relevant information. This can also be used in a file.

```
$ grep -m 10 "India" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToIndia.txt

If you do not specify a number, the command will not run.
